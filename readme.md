## Introduction

JSAP is a new audio effects framework for the HTML 5 web audio API for building audio plugins. The standard defines both the host and plugin parts.

## Usage

JSAP is made up of two parts, the plugins and the factory. The factory enables a website (host) to integrate and use JSAP plugin instances with ease. The plugins themselves are built on top of a BasePlugin JavaScript object, binding certain functions together.

To include the JSAP library into a host, simply include the 'jsap.js' file in your project, for example:

```html
<script src="jsap.js"></script>
```
